# New-Microsoft-Rewards

Uses PyAutoGui library to automate the process of Microsoft Rewards
Using PyAutoGui practically makes it impossible to get banned since it simulates real clicks and key strokes
(I am not responsible if you get banned though)

Features
 - Daily set
 - Activities
 - Search
 - User Interface (made with PyQt5)
